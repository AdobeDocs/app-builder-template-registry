# Get Started

## Contributing to Template Registry

- Follow this [guide](guides/creating_template/) to create an App Builder template.
- Make sure the template meets these [requirements](guides/requirements/) because it will have to pass automated checks in order to be included in the Template Registry.
- You can submit a template to Template Registry for review by using either its [Github repository](/reference/github/index.md), the [Adobe I/O CLI](/reference/cli/index.md), or the Template Registry [API](/reference/api/index.md). 

## Using App Builder templates

Looking to get started on a new App Builder project and need a skeleton? Use Template Registry via [Adobe I/O CLI](/reference/cli/) to
1. [**discover**](/reference/cli/#aio-templatesdiscover) different templates for various use cases
2. [**install**](/reference/cli/#aio-templatesinstall) a suitable template for your purposes
3. [**check**](/reference/cli/#aio-templatesinfo) what templates are currently installed
4. [**uninstall**](/reference/cli/#aio-templatesuninstall) a template you don't need anymore from your current project
5. [**rollback**](/reference/cli/#aio-templatesrollback) all currently installed templates
