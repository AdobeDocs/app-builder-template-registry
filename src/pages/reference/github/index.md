# Using Template Registry's Github repository

[Add](reference/#add-a-template), [update](reference/#update-a-template), and [remove](reference/#remove-a-template) templates from Template Registry through its Github repository, which can be found here: [https://github.com/adobe/aio-template-submission](https://github.com/adobe/aio-template-submission).

## Add a template

##### Request to add a new template to the Template Registry and run [validation checks](https://github.com/adobe/aio-lib-template-validation) on the template's metadata.

1. Navigate to [issues](https://github.com/adobe/aio-template-submission/issues) in the Template Registry submission Github repository.
2. Click `New issue` to create a new issue.
3. Select `Get started` for `Template Review Request`.
4. Fill in link to github repository that holds source code of template.
5. Fill in the name of the NPM package the template was published as. Include scope (e.g. @adobe/app-builder-template).
6. Use name of the NPM package as the title of the issue as well.
7. Click `Submit new issue`.
8. If template has passed the verification process and been successfully added to the registry, a comment will appear on the issue with the message "Congratulations! Your template has been verified and added to App Builder Template Registry.".
9. If template fails the verification process (outlined [here](/reference)), a comment detailing the failed checks will appear.
10. After the mentioned issues are addressed, the verification process can be triggered again by commenting `/check` on the issue.

After passing automatic checks, templates by third-party developers will initially be assigned a status "InVerification" indicating they still need to be verified by Adobe. An Adobe team member will have to review and manually approve the template for it to gain full "Approved" status.

## Update a template

##### Update the entry of a template that already exists in the Template Registry. 

1. Navigate to [issues](https://github.com/adobe/aio-template-submission/issues) in the Template Registry submission Github repository.
2. Click `New issue` to create a new issue.
3. Select `Get started` for `Template Update Request`.
4. Fill in the name of the NPM package that contains the template. Include scope (e.g. @adobe/app-builder-template).
5. Use the name of the NPM package as the issue title as well.
6. Click `Submit new issue`.
7. If update is successful, a comment will appear on the issue with the message "The template has been updated in Template Registry.".

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

Only the original owner that added the template to the registry may update a template. If not the original owner, contact the Developer Experience team at [devx-services@adobe.com](devx-services@adobe.com) to update a template.

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

Templates by third-party developers will need to be re-approved manually by an Adobe team member to regain "Approved" status after each new version.
